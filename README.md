## Installing

This is a simple Rust program so you can either build it from source or download one of the [pre-compiled binaries](https://github.com/Stay1444/rotn-save-editor/releases) that I uploaded.

## Save Location

On Windows the save game is located under `C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\LocalLow\Brace Yourself Games\Rift of the NecroDancer\Saves\`
